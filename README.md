# StoneChallenge

# Usage

To import the function calculateBillParts into another file:
```python
from stone import *
```

Or just write the list entries in `stone.py` and call the function with them

# Tests
I wrote unit tests in `test_stone.py` but didn't stressed out the algorithm with large lists, to run the tests:
```bash
pytest
```
